# House rental website
This repository contains a website project for renting houses. The website is written in Django and consists of a sqlite database and several dynamic pages with filtering and booking forms.

## Why was this project written
This is my first Django learning project. It contains a large number of comments that I originally wrote for myself, in order to form an understanding of the concept of ORM and other aspects of working with the Django framework.

You can watch this project for an introduction to my mindset and my coding culture. At least as of December 2022.
